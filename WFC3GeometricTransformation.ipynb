    "This notebook was originally intended to be a full working example of how this process should work, but obviously the amount of work needed to actually accomplish this feat is much larger than anyone realistically imagined. That being said, hopefully this notebook adequately shows that we can get there, and outlines how we should get there. In summary, here's what needs to be done in order to actually get this notebook to be functional:\n",
    "1. ~~Gather the WFC3 distortion models from a WFC3 Subject Matter Expert~~\n",
    "2. ~~\"Genericize\" or make a WFC3-specific version of create_grism_specwcs~~\n",
    "    * ~~This should be fairly straight forward, considering the GRISMCONF input conffile for the WFC3 grisms already exists~~\n",
    "3. ~~Similarly, \"Genericize\" or make a WFC3-specific version of create_tsgrism_wavelengthrange~~\n",
    "4. ~~Create the WFC3 GRISM Dispersion Models to injest the grism trace models~~\n",
    "    * ~~Arguably, the center piece of the original purpose of JDAT-12~~\n",
    "5. ~~Create the WFC3 imaging model to apply the given distortions onto~~\n",
    "    * ~~From my perspective, this one has the highest \"black-box, unknown score\" associated with it~~\n",
    "    \n",
